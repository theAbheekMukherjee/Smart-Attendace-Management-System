# Smart-Attendace-Management-System
Face recognition for live attendance logging and file management.
1. **Face Recognition:** The code uses OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library to detect and recognize faces in images.

2. **Live Attendance Logging:** It captures live video from a webcam, recognizes students, and logs their attendance in real-time into a CSV file.

3. **File Management:** The code organizes attendance records by creating a folder named "attendance_report" and moving CSV files into it.
